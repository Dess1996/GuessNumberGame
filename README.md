# Basic
This is a simple numerical guessing game. This project was inspired by the <a link='https://stepik.org/course/58852/'>course</a> "Python Generation: A Course for Beginners" .
Since I already have programming experience, I decided to develop a mini-game using OOP.


# Rules
1. You press start the game
2. and try to guess what the computer has guessed.
3. the player can always pause the game and if necessary to view statistics, reload or quit the game


# Start
1. Clone repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dess1996/GuessNumberGame.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start:
```bash
python3 main.py
```


# Future
1. Connect the database to show statistics.
2. Add a difficulty choice.
3. Add a graphical interface.
